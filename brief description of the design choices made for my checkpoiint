Branding: The header features a distinct store logo, and social icons are included for easy sharing.
SEO: Meta tags for description and keywords help search engines index your site.
User Engagement: Interactive elements like hover effects, carousel, and “Add to Cart” buttons encourage user interaction.
These choices create a professional, user-friendly, and visually appealing shopping experience.
